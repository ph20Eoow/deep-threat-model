# Deep-ThreatModel 
Deep-TreatModel is an advanced threat modeling tool that leverages multiple AI agents to craft comprehensive and reliable threat models. By distributing the workload across specialized agents, Deep-TM meticulously analyzes design documents, identifies threats using the STRIDE framework, and researches mitigations from authoritative sources like OWASP, and MITRE. This collaborative approach ensures that the resulting threat models are not only deeply researched but also thoroughly verified, providing you with dependable insights tailored to your system’s architecture.
