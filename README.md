2. Google API Key and CSE ID:
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new project (or use an existing one).
   - Enable the Custom Search API in the API Library.
   - Generate an API key under Credentials > Create Credentials > API Key.
   - Set up a Custom Search Engine (CSE) at Google CSE and obtain your CSE ID.
