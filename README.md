# DeepThreatModel 
DeepThreatModel, or Deep-TM, is a tool that utilizes a set of AI agents to compose threat models. The generated results are expected to be deeply researched, verified, and ready for inclusion in your documents.

## Features
### AI Agent
The bespoke DeepSearch capability:

- Automatically looks up threats and attack techniques from reliable security sources (e.g., OWASP, MITRE, CVE).
- Infrastructure awareness: if your diagram includes services from a cloud provider, it also looks up the corresponding security practice guide for that provider.
  
### Editor
- Mimick Confluence/Notion block editor experience, letting you paste and generate threat modeling in a few steps
- Support mermaid markdown 


## Quick Start with Docker Compose
To use DeepThreatModel, youâ€™ll need API keys for OpenAI and Google Custom Search Engine (CSE). Below are instructions on how to obtain them, followed by steps to set up the project using Docker Compose.

### Retrieving API Keys
1. OpenAI API Key:
   - Sign up for an account at OpenAI.
   - Once logged in, navigate to the API section and generate a new API key.
   - Copy this key for use in the .env file.
2. Google API Key and CSE ID:
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new project (or use an existing one).
   - Enable the Custom Search API in the API Library.
   - Generate an API key under Credentials > Create Credentials > API Key.
   - Set up a Custom Search Engine (CSE) at Google CSE and obtain your CSE ID.
   - Copy both the API key and CSE ID for use in the .env file.

### Setup the container
1. Clone or Download the Project 
2. Create your `.env`
    ```bash
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
        GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_actual_google_cse_id
    ```
3. Build and Start the Containers `docker compose up -d`
4. Access at `http://localhost:5173`
